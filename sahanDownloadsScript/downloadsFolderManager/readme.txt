Automating the task of managing the downloads directory in windows and linux (not in mac)
When a user downloads images or music or any other, all files will be saved automatically in the downloads folders if you are using chrome(most use chrome).
this python script when runned will move these files into thier seperate folders rearranging them so that we dont have to manually arrange them in seperate folders.
please write a issue for me if u need other file types to implement, as i have only put a few (example :- .docx for word files).
thank you
